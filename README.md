# Welcome to BJCollins.tech

The portfolio site for BJ Collins, a web developer based in the Denver, CO area.

## Coming Very Soon...

I will be adding a "Choose a Theme" option to the hero section. Over time I will be adding new and distinct themes to the site, and instead of just changing the current theme I will allow visitors to pick which theme they'd like to see.

The name of the current theme is RainbOverload and coming down the pipeline shortly is an 80's theme (working title: The Crayties).

I'd love to have community participation with adding new themes. With that in mind feel free to send me suggestions for new themes as well as submit a pull request if you've made one of your own. Simply create a new CSS file that I can easily link to.

## Projects

The Projects section houses the ever-growing list of projects I've worked on as well as links to those projects. Projects will be added as they are completed.

## Set Up

This site was made using the React front-end framework. To set up this project locally, fork this repo, clone it to your machine locally, and run npm install inside the main folder. This will install all dependencies.
